[Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) just published their lesson
["Data Organization in Spreadsheets"](http://www.datacarpentry.org/spreadsheet-ecology-lesson/)
via Zenodo (see [here](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.570047)). I've made a small
contribution to that lesson as a part of my Data Carpentry instructor training
checkout last year. Amazing to see how easy it is now to add it to
[my ORCID record](http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5299-3292) using DataCite search.
