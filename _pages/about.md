I am a member of the 
[Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Computational Algebra](https://twitter.com/CIRCA_StAndrews)
and one of the developers of the open-source system 
[GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/), which is used for research and teaching in 
the study of groups and their representations, rings, algebras, semigroups,
combinatorial structures, and other discrete mathematical objects. 
I am involved in multiple aspects of GAP development, 
including release management, regression tests, liaising with package
authors wishing to contribute their developments to GAP,
as well as technical support and user training.

One source of my motivation to make GAP better comes from using GAP in my
own mathematical research – to search for examples and counterexamples,
to automate routine calculations and to find arguments needed for proofs.
This often requires substantial computational resources and combining
different tools, which has naturally led me into the area of parallel
computations and interfaces design. I have been involved in the 
EPRSC-funded HPC-GAP project where we working on reengineering the GAP
system to take advantage of the power of current and future high-performance
computers, and prior to that – in the European project 
[SCIEnce - Symbolic Computation Infrastructure for Europe](http://www.symbolic-computing.org/).
Currently I am a co-investigator on the EPSRC-funded 
[CCP CoDiMa – Collaborative Computational Project in Computational Discrete Mathematics](http://www.codima.ac.uk/)
and on the [Horizon 2020 project OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org/).

I am a member of the [GAP Council](http://www.gap-system.org/Contacts/People/Council/council.html)
and the [GAP Support group](http://www.gap-system.org/Contacts/People/supportgroup.html),
a Fellow of the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/),
an editor of the [Journal of Software for Algebra and Geometry](http://j-sag.org/)
and the [Journal of Open Research Software](http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/),
and an instructor for [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/)
and [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/).
